In this sample we see how to create some basic models and relations.

We will have groups of entities. A group will be defined with two entities:
- `GroupN`, a group of items;
- `ItemN`, an individual item.

We will have `Group1`, `Item1`, but also `Group2`, `Item2`, etc. to show different kinds of relations..
